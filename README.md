# Problem Statement : Throw Dice
You and your two other team members are doing your construct week project. An issue arises in your project and all three of you come up with a solution. All the three solutions are feasible and each one of you wants to implement his own solution. Hence all of you decided to roll a dice and whoever gets the maximum score will implement his solution. But the problem is you cannot roll a dice online, so you, being an active team member, decided to make an app with three dice showing a random number between 1 to 6 as described below.

# Description :-
🌟Create an Index.html file

🌟Create three “DIV”, which will represent three dice and show a random number between 1 to 6.

🌟First will represent score for Member A

🌟Second will represent score for Member B

🌟And third will represent score for Member C

🌟Make a button with text content “ROLL THE DICE”

🌟On pressing the button all the three dice should roll and show a random number between 1 to 6.

🌟Make a “DIV” at the top which will show the winner.

# Things to follow :-
